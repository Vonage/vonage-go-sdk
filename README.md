This is the community-supported Golang library for [Vonage](https://vonage.com). It has support for a handful of our APIs, but is no longer active development. Issues, pull requests, and other input are very welcome. The [package documentation is available on pkg.go](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/vonage/vonage-go-sdk).

If you don't already know Vonage: We make telephony APIs. If you need to make a call, check a phone number, or send an SMS then you are in the right place! If you don't have one yet, you can [sign up for a Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=DEV_REL&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_campaign=vonage-go) and get some free credit to get you started.

## Contributions

Yes please! This library is open source, community-driven, and benefits greatly from the input of its users.

Please make all your changes on a branch, and open a pull request, these are welcome and will be reviewed with delight! If it's a big change, it is recommended to open an issue for discussion before you start.

All changes require tests to go with them.

### Using a Local Branch

Refer to [this excellent blog post](https://thewebivore.com/using-replace-in-go-mod-to-point-to-your-local-module/) for instructions on how to use a local clone of this repository as the import in your own project. This is really useful when you are using a version of the library other than the latest stable release - for example if you are working on a change, or testing an open pull request.
