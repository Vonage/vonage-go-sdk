To Do List
==========

## Important

- Write tests using modified VCR
- Write response parser that will handle different error types.

## Extensions

- Complete Developer API
- Add WebHook support

## Housekeeping
- Use a serializeable date type in structs?
- Rename Voice calls `client.Calls.Create()` etc.
- Hide AuthSet struct inside Client
- Rename structs so they appear near their Services by name.
- Move structs.go contents into separate API files.
- Move unnecessary named structs into parent structs as anonymous structs.
- Rename `NewClient` to `New`
- Documentation!

## Future

Not now, but maybe not too distant:

- OAuth support
- Key/Sig support
